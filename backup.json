We could give up a lot of other vegetables before we would not grow this queen of garden crops, known for its divine taste and snake-like beauty. So snake-like, in fact, that the beans terrify more than a few visitors to our garden each summer! Snake bean is almost completely absent in U.S. markets. Its long, delicate fruit doesn\u2019t ship easily. Chinese Green Python snake bean is the largest snake bean variety, growing up to 60 inches long and 1.5 inches thick! As it matures, it develops bright green color and a thin layer of wax on the skin. When harvested at 12-30 inches long, it can be used like green beans or summer squash. Traditionally stir fried with peppers and onions, this vegetable has many culinary uses. In Africa the inside of fully mature fruit can be scraped out and used like tomato paste. This variety will need a sturdy trellis; pinching lateral branches under 30 inches will encourage climbing. Fun to grow in kids\u2019 gardens; an absolutely unique new vegetable!",

"Pole. An early maturing and supremely delicious winged bean from Japan. This highly adaptable winged bean variety is not day length sensitive, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of growing areas. Winged beans are native to equatorial Asia. Baker Creek\u2019s founder, Jere Gettle, first encountered winged beans on a trip to Thailand. Being a tropical crop from the equator, the winged bean typically takes a long season to flower, only setting pods just before frost in our Missouri climate. For years Jere searched for a winged bean variety that would bear pods earlier in order to enjoy a longer harvest season. Urizun is just the variety he had been searching for; this variety will begin to produce pods in August and heavy production continues until frost. This heat-loving vegetable is especially popular on the island of Okinawa, Japan, where it takes center stage during the warm summer months. Vines are lush and tropical looking, with large, lavender flowers and unique pods. The vines will readily climb a trellis or fence, making this an exotic edible ornamental. Traditionally blanched and stir fried with ume (pickled Japanese plum), we love to toss them into the wok with just about anything; they are also great in soups or steamed.

Chioggia beet originated in the historic fishing town of Chioggia, Italy, just across the lagoon from Venice. Dubbed \u201cLittle Venice\u201d for its canals and ancient charm, local Venetians know that Chioggia is the town to visit for authentic family-style food. It also has a reputation among Italians for retaining food traditions and quality cuisine. Chioggia beet was first mentioned by legendary French seedhouse Vilmorin in 1840. When introduced in the U.S., Chioggia beet was considered a gourmet oddity, primarily sold at upscale markets. The unusual rings were a startling departure from the typical red beet, and so the variety was not immediately embraced by the public. Today the Chioggia beet remains a popular choice for market farmers. The crisp crunch of the candy cane striped roots have the culinary stamp of approval from top chefs the world over. Those who are averse to the signature earthy flavor of other beets will appreciate this variety, as the flavor is remarkably mellow. The greens are crisp and high quality. The flesh is very tender, mild, and sweet.",

"The unusual name stirs intrigue, as beets are historically considered a crop of the European sea coast. The earthy roots are not typically associated with Egypt. In fact, this is not a true Egyptian variety! This misnomer is most likely thanks to the \u201cEgyptomania\u201d that swept Europe and America during the 19th century. Napoleon\u2019s famous Egyptian campaign sparked western interest in Egypt, influencing 1800s art, religion and even the false-marketing of some goods as \u201cEgyptian.\u201d For example, the 1888 edition of J.H. Gregory\u2019s seed catalog features Egyptian beets, as well as Egyptian sweet corn. This old European variety was likely named Egyptian beet to add exotic flare to its description.

In the late 1980s, Akio Ujihara, a professor emeritus from Shinshu University in Japan, collected seeds for a unique flowering buckwheat from Yunnan, China, at about 12,000 feet elevation. The professor selected and perfected this variety, and the signature red blanketed fields can now be found in Nara Prefecture, Japan. Japanese farmers quickly embraced this as a stunning cover crop, much more beautiful than white buckwheat. Tourism in the area to see the pink and red buckwheat fields has skyrocketed. The seeds are ground into a flour for soba noodles and can also be sprouted for a highly nutritious microgreen. In Japan, buckwheat is also brewed into tea and made into cookies. Honey from bees who fed on ruby buckwheat was analyzed by Shinshu University and shown to contain 100 times the antioxidant effect of regular honey.",

Golden Beauty cabbage is reminiscent of lettuce hearts for its buttery, super melt-in-your mouth texture. We can\u2019t get enough of this ultra-refined super flavorful variety that is simply the best for stir fry, hot pots and soups. This nutritious type of cabbage has been cultivated in China for over 1000 years. It is considered a culinary staple and cultural symbol, featured in everything from poetry and literature to artwork and even song! Chinese cabbage was celebrated as a medicinal food by prominent naturalist of the Ming dynasty, Li Shizen. After receiving the superfood stamp of approval, Chinese cabbage exploded in popularity and has remained a beloved green since. Introduced over 100 years ago to the United States, this vegetable was received with much fanfare as a nutritious Chinese introduction. The golden yellow variety has increased nutritional benefits and it provides more than twice the potassium of standard broccoli and is replete with minerals and vitamins. The fiber-rich yellow heads are more than equal to whole milk in terms of calcium content and is more bioavailable than milk, meaning your body is able to more effectively use the calcium in chinese cabbage. In our tests the Golden Beauty variety contains about 40% more minerals than standard green varieties. This variety is beloved for its superior mild, sweet, flavor and brilliant lemon yellow color when grown in the right, cool conditions.

"A beautiful spotted variety that is descended from a historic Native American variety. Ed Schultz, renowned corn breeder from Montana, has worked to adapt a blended corn as a tribute to a sacred Native American variety. Cudu corn is said to be an ancient native American variety used for sacred ritual. A sample of seeds was donated to the USDA seed bank by Oscar Will in 1958. The original donated seed may have been accidentally inbred or crossed, as the cobs were stunted and short, and kernels had begun to lose their signature blue eagle marking. Ed is a far northern grower who has worked to create beautiful and early-maturing corns like Atomic Orange and the Papa\u2019s corn. He received a sample of seeds from the USDA and has worked for over five years to adapt it to his northern region and to create longer cobs. He reports that this variety has long, slender ears and beautiful blue-spotted kernels. To achieve this variety, he bred true Cudu corn with a small percentage of Papa\u2019s White corn.",

"A stunning lavender colored flour corn with long slender 8-12 inch long ears in an attractive pastel shade that produces silky, soft cornmeal. This vigorous and early producing corn was bred by Ed Schutlz of Montana. Ed has made a name for himself as an expert corn breeder with great knowledge and respect for the Native American corn varieties that he loves to works with. One look at the unmistakable lavender kernels shows that this blended Native American variety is descended from the lavender parching corn of the Mandan tribe. In 1808, Thomas Jefferson received seeds of a lavender colored, Mandan Red Clay corn; he reported that the seeds were given to him by Lewis and Clark from their 1804 contact with the Mandan tribe in present day North Dakota. Schultz has taken the lovely lavender-clay color and rugged cold hardiness of Mandan corn while making for more slender and uniform ears and short, stout plants. A stellar feat of breeding from a solid foundation of superlative ancient genetics.",

This variety is a northern adapted homage to the legendary Maiz Morado/Kulli corn from Peru. Ed Shultz, the accomplished and passionate open pollinated corn breeder who spent 30 years selecting this dark purple variety, explains that Mountain Morado is was actually selected from Painted Mountain corn. Perfect for those northern gardeners who have always dreamed of growing dark purple corn to brew into the popular healthful corn drink, chicha morada. This slightly variable, Montana landrace is well adapted to super long summer days and cool nights, however it will also perform well (and mature even earlier) in shorter day length areas. Short, stocky plants produce an average of 2 ears per plant, with 8 row, long slender cobs. Can also be milled into a supremely soft, delicious flour.",

Farmers of yesteryear regarded it highly for the copious foliage or organic matter it produced, making it an exemplary soil-improving companion crop to corn. Since the early 1900s, a number of seed catalogs have lauded this variety for its drought and heat tolerance. A look back through antique American catalogs, especially those from companies in the Southeastern U.S., shows that Red Ripper was a must have on the farm as a sustainable soil builder and delicious treat. This heirloom creates long, running vines, smothered in long 12-14 inch pods that are loaded with nutritious peas, up to 18 in a single shell! The flowers are a beautiful blue and the immature pods make a perfect green bean substitute. In its native range in Africa, the cowpea has historically been grown alongside millet and sorghum as a nurse crop to improve soil. George Washington Carver also sang the praises of this almost-miraculous soil saver. The seeds for cowpeas were brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans, and over subsequent centuries this legume has revived ravaged soils and nourished many.",

The crop is believed to have been brought from western China to the east during the Han dynasty in 216. Cucumbers have long been selected and perfected in China for sweet, nutty gourmet flavor. This variety is an homage to those many years of natural breeding. The long, slender, thin-skinned fruit will develop without pollination, making a seedless and burpless cuke. In Chinese medicine the cucumber is used as a natural refrigerant in the intense heat of summer. The cooling effect is said to soothe heat-related ailments and even heat-induced bouts of anger! A favorite in our trials; we just love the flavor and gemstone-colored flesh! Try growing this variety in a greenhouse without pollinators!

These \u201ctrue lemon cucumber\u201d seeds were sold at a bargain price of $1 per seed! Indeed, the lemon cucumber is a pretty convincing fake, with round, lemon-yellow fruit and a swollen blossom end, just like a real lemon. Alas, the lemon cuke is a true cucumber, a result of naturally selecting for round, yellow fruit. The lemon cucumber originated in the late 19th century and was introduced to the U.S. in 1894. The tasty fruit is low in cucurbitacin, that naturally occurring cucumber chemical that accounts for a slightly bitter taste. The flesh is citrusy and adds a real zip to salads!

Use the young leaves in salads, older leaves as boiled greens. Roots can be roasted and used in place of coffee, or lifted and forced during winter, like Belgian Endive. We\u2019re proud to offer this European strain of a traditional old favorite!",

The black goji is known to be more healthful and potent than the more widely known red goji, and we find the flavor sweeter. The tasty, inky black berries are exceptionally high in antioxidants and are said to boost the immune system and improve circulation. Thanks to their ability to fight free radicals, they have been hailed as a food to promote healthy, graceful aging. The potent berries create an outstanding blue color when steeped or added to foods. These tasty berries are quickly becoming a popular super fruit added to smoothies and brewed into tea. The dried berries are great in granola and muffins or snacked on alone; you can also eat the berries fresh off the plant. Steep the berries into a beautiful blue tea; adding a few drops of lemon will turn the tea a lovely purple/pink color. Gardeners will be pleased to know this exciting berry is highly prolific and easy to grow! Plants thrive in zones 5-10. It grows as a shrub reaching 4-6 feet in height, and the plants are self fertile. The fruit ripens from summer through early fall.",

"75 days. An antioxidant rich garden berry that undergoes the most miraculous flavor transformation when cooked and just lightly sweetened! There is a stark contrast between eating the berries raw and cooked and sweetened state. The raw ripe berries have a tart flavor, similar to tomatillo, yummy for savory snacking and salsas. The cooked and lightly sweetened berries are reminiscent of blackberry or gooseberry. The garden huckleberry is native to Africa and is a solanaceous berry in the tomato family. The intense purple black hue of the berries indicates high levels of the antioxidant anthocyanin. We adore this nutritious, quick maturing annual which produces masses of fruit in a short season. For very best flavor it is important to harvest at the correct stage. Berries will be a shiny, green to black when under-mature; at this stage the flavor will be unpleasant and the berries may be slightly poisonous. The berries mature to a dull black color and should be slightly soft to the touch; at this point the berries are perfect to eat and quite tasty. The truly spectacular flavor of these berries is revealed when the berries are cooked and sweetened; this brings out a fruity, blackberry-like flavor that is simply sublime. We have seen these berries re-imagined into delectable jams, pies, syrups and fillings--easily one of the most rewarding fruit crops to grow!",

"From Portugal, Germany, and China, kale has made traditional soups and provided people with their staple greens. While Red Ursa is a relatively new addition to the rainbow of kales, its roots run deep. The Red Russian and Siberian kales originate from northern Europe and northern Asia, and some of the varieties have been traced back to Russian traders migrating to Canada in the late 1800s. Kale is a crop that has evolved and cross-pollinated over the years, and Frank Morton of Wild Garden Seed in Corvallis, Oregon, has kept this tradition going with his kale breeding efforts. In the \u201890s he crossed a Siberian Kale with a Red Russian Kale to form what is now Red Ursa. In 1997, Red Ursa was entered into the National Variety trials and chosen as one of the top five vegetables of the year!

Peter Miller of Kings Seed mentioned that Thousandhead kale was long appreciated in the UK as a fodder crop, but it has been rediscovered as a tasty culinary variety.

This seed was sourced from Kings Seed of England; the King family has been in the seed business for centuries. John Kemp King began selling seeds in 1793; his grandson Ernest William began Kings Seeds, and it has been in business for 130 years!

This variety has been cultivated for centuries in Istanbul\u2019s famous urban gardens, called Bostanlar. These ancient gardens are now threatened by urban sprawl; thankfully, there has been a resurgence of attention from local seed savers to keep this variety from going extinct. This variety has been recognized by the Ark of Taste as a beloved culinary symbol of the historic gardens. A romaine type with long leaves, a crisp center and white seeds. Locals report that the incredible flavor and tender leaves are so juicy and high in natural oils that there is no need for dressing.

"75-90 days. The most intriguing garden berry we have ever seen, and with superb creamy and mild cherry flavor. A totally unique fruit, it is delightful to imagine litchi tomato into myriad culinary interpretations from mock cherry pies to chutneys and pickles. Its Latin name is Solanum sisymbriifolium, but it goes by many aliases, Vila Vila in Latin America, litchi tomato in the U.S and in France, Morelle de Balbis. It is a favorite fruit here at Baker Creek and has even been seen growing in the home garden of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. While the alien like plants may seem like a new innovation, litchi tomato was celebrated in seed catalogs of antiquity as an exotic and delicious fruit. The 1896 Wilson\u2019s Seed Farm catalog featured a plant referred to as (Solanum anthrophagorum) it was described as a bright red fruit that lends well to pies and sauces. The Wilson\u2019s catalog also told of the fruit being used as a condiment for a cannibals meal of human flesh in Fiji. Botanists believe the litchi tomato to be native to South America, yet early accounts mention it as a plant growing in the islands of the South Pacific. Large plants grow to 5\u2019 and are covered with thorns; sweet red fruit and large white flowers. Lovely to look at, but be careful with the thorns! The fruit is about the size of a cherry and taste like a cherry crossed with a tomato. A very pretty and attractive plant that originated in South America, but has been naturalized in many countries. You can grow litchi tomato just as you would grow regular tomatoes.",

"A mammoth heirloom okra from West Africa that produces gargantuan edible leaves and delicious pods. This outstanding okra was introduced to us by Jon Jackson, a retired U.S. Army Airborne Ranger and founder of Comfort Farms, a non-profit agriculture program focused on helping veterans to heal and learn sustainable farming practices. Jon\u2019s mother hails from Liberia, West Africa, so on a quest to learn about his ancestral farming roots, he came across this remarkable variety of okra that is considered a productive and reliable staple in his mother\u2019s homeland, as well as in other parts of West Africa. Jon grows the seeds for this okra on his farm in Georgia. There, the late-maturing plants grow to 15 feet tall with elephant ear-sized leaves, but the plants will express themselves differently depending on the climate in which they are grown. Other gardeners report plants averaging 6-8 feet. The pods are an unusual round shape and not entirely spineless. They are exquisite and versatile in cooked dishes, and can even be eaten raw when young. The leaves are also edible when cooked, and in their native range they are traditionally made into soup.",

"A very rare and amazing garden pea! One of the most historical peas known, this particular variety is said to have been taken out of the tomb of famed Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, or King Tut. The story is that his servants planted and harvested these peas to help provide for his afterlife. Though some claim to have debunked the story, Lynn McKee\u2019s family tradition asserts that her father received the seeds found in the boy King\u2019s tomb, where they had been undisturbed for nearly 5,000 years until Howard Carter found the tomb on Nov. 4, 1922. From there, as the legend goes, the seeds were taken to England where they were propagated and shared with friends. \u201cThe conditions within Egyptian pyramids are very dry and would permit seed longevity in certain species to extend to thousands of years,\u201d one document said. Some claim, though, it is likely the seeds originated in early 20th century English gardens. The Fortean Times says \u201cIt is sometimes said that Tutankhamun\u2019s Pea originated on the country estate of Lord Caernarvon, who financed Howard Carter\u2019s search for King Tut\u2019s resting place and was subsequently named in honor of Caernarvon\u2019s claim to fame, rather than the plant\u2019s origin.\u201d As an interesting turn to the story, we located the seed and found the story from Japanese seed collectors during our travels there. Stunning fuschia purple flowers give way to tasty, fat purple pods on strong and vigorous plants that love cool weather. This variety has proven highly productive and makes a delicious soup pea, or picked young as a purple snow pea. Try this piece of living history in your garden!",

Reaching only 8 to 9 inches in height, it\u2019s grown mainly as a shelling type, but the pods are also sweet, tender and delicious when harvested very young. This variety excels when tucked into small spaces around the garden, and for cold-frame production very early or very late in the season. This unusual heirloom originated in England and was first introduced in the U.S. by Landreth Seeds, Philadelphia, in 1854. Even more frost tolerant than most other pea varieties, and, naturally, it requires no staking!",

"Selling for very high prices to Lima\u2019s best chefs, this pepper is the most expensive in the world! The north Peruvian jungle native is a wild bushy plant which produces hundreds of hot, small (.25 inch), round Tepin-like peppers. The pepper has a distinct fruity, citrus aroma and is equal in heat to a cayenne pepper. Due to its rarity and hefty prices, it is often known as the \"Mother of All Chilis\" and is very hard to source outside of Peru. We are happy here at Baker Creek to bring such an amazing pepper to light! Used fresh, this tiny pepper is known to have a strong fruity flavor that gives salsas and sauces a unique tropical taste. More often, it is used as powder for various dishes. Baker Creek's Shannie McCabe and Deb Vlietstra found this variety growing in a pot in a Peruvian friend's house. Indeed, the Aji Charapita is a popular house plant in Peru, where the delicious peppers are harvested as needed right in the kitchen.",

This crispy fleshed pepper clocks in at about 30,000 Scoville Heat Units, which is six times hotter than a jalape\u00f1o. If you prefer your peppers on the milder side, harvest them when green. Our friend Ligia Parisi, who grows Aji Crystal at her farm in Chile, describes using them to create a delicious salsa called Pebre, which is similar to Pico de Gallo.

"A beautiful and delicious pepper from eastern North Macedonia. This Jalapeno-level hot pepper was brought to us by Steve Neumann, who also introduced the phenomenal and uniquely etched Rheza pepper and the Ajvarksi pepper. Steve collected the seeds for this variety while visiting the village of Kalugeritsa. This super rare pepper is not known outside of the region, and he was unable to find a variety name; therefore the pepper bears the name of the little town in which it is grown. We love this pretty little pointed pepper. The flavor is full bodied and is one of the best peppers for roasting!",

"65 days. Also known as \u201cCuban pepper\u201d, the Cubanelle is a variety of sweet pepper commonly used in Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Dominican cuisine. Many cooks prefer it to bell types. Sweet Cubanelle peppers can some times be slightly hot, but with only a touch of heat. This 6-8-inch pepper is prized for its sweet, mild flesh, rich flavor, and pretty colors. The thin-walled pepper is especially suited for quick cooking and has a low water content. Best picked when yellow-green for use in roasting, stuffing, as a pizza topping, for frying, a substitute for Anaheim peppers, or in a yellow mole sauce, and is one of the traditional ingredients in sofrito. They can also be left to mature and harvested when bright orange-red. In the garden, in addition to their famed taste and colors, the Cubanelle peppers are also known for their unique, imperfectly curled, wrinkled, and twisted shapes--no two seem to ever be alike.",

"A multicolored sweet pepper and a beloved heirloom of the Philadelphia African American community of the early 1900s. A delightfully ornamental sweet pepper that features purple flowers and fruit that transforms from dark purple, to mustard yellow and finally to a vibrant orange as it ripens. We can thank Philadelphia folk artist Horrace Pippin for this extraordinary pepper, as he shared his seeds with William Woys Weaver\u2019s grandfather in the early 1940\u2019s. History remembers Pippin as the first African American painter to be known for expressing his concern about war and social injustices in the themes of his art. His right arm was badly injured in battle during his service in WWI, and as the story goes, Pippin sought out bee sting therapy to alleviate his suffering. H. Ralf Weaver exchanged stings from his hive of bees with Pippin for the seeds of this pepper and other heirlooms that Pippin had collected. These heirlooms are considered heritage varieties of an African American community of the mid-Atlantic during Pippin\u2019s time. A very rare and unique variety.",

The village of Corrales was founded on the banks of the Rio Grande, and the Spanish colonists had brought safflower seeds possibly collected from their stop in the Island of La Palma, in the Canary Islands, where a famous strain was then cultivated. This Corrales Azafran strain has stayed close to this original seed brought to New Mexico. It is widely adapted; flowers can be used as a coloring spice, dried to brew tea and also, a dye with a deep orange, almost red, pigment. The young plants make a delicious leafy green. The seeds can be pressed into oil. The deep taproots are a very efficient soil breaker.",

Perhaps most intriguing quality is its small bright red berries! Young under ripe berries will be mild in flavor and appropriate for salads and savory applications, allow the berries to fully ripen to a deep crimson for juicy sweet flavor. We find the ripe berries to have a watermelon-berry flavor, addictive for snacking and irresistible for deserts. Like its spinach cousin, the leaves are high in oxalates so those with sensitivities to oxalates should take note. The delicious edible berries contain small seeds that in very large quantity may haves some toxic effects, but are considered perfectly safe when consumed in relative moderation. The very easy to grow and adaptable plants grow in a similar fashion to their wild cousin, lambsquarter. The original seeds for this particular variety were found in a monastery garden in Europe.",

A very similar variety of squash can still be found in Central American markets from Mexico to Belize, where its ancestor originated. Unlike its Mexican counterpart, the Yuxi Jiang Bing Gua squash from China is not day length sensitive, making it much easier to grow in the U.S. Baker Creek\u2019s founder Jere Gettle first saw this similar type of squash in markets in Mexico, where the green flattened fruit is typically eaten as a tender summer squash. He was surprised to see the same type at markets in Fang, Thailand, and in China. Later research explained that in China, this variety is called Jiang Bing Gua, and is most popular in the city of Yuxi, where the fruit is harvested when young and tender and used as a summer squash. In northern China, the fruit is left to mature into a delicious and sweet winter squash. We love this squash at both stages; the young fruit is tender with a nutty flavor and buttery texture, while the mature fruit is delectable, creamy, with sweet, deep orange flesh. The unusual ribbed fruit makes a beautiful display in autumn. Each 3- to 8-pound fruit is incredibly deeply ribbed; most unusual of all is the way the top of each fruit dramatically recurves toward the stem, sometimes completely enfolding it!",

Seeds from the large green squash that originated in South America were shared with local seedsman J.H Gregory. A savvy breeder, Gregory selected the Hubbard\u2019s skin to a more unique blue color and devoted his career to marketing the massive fruit. Gregory credited a Miss Hubbard as the person who originally gifted him the seed; he noted that she told him it was the best tasting squash she had ever tried and that she was given the seeds from a captain aboard a ship from the West Indies. A conflicting account from a local Marblehead woman stated that Miss Hubbard had bred the squash in her home garden from seeds originally brought on the ship from the West Indies. Either way, the colossal blue squash was naturally a great choice for a long sea journey as the thick skin makes for a longer shelf life. Blue Hubbard squash is known for keeping up to 6 months in the pantry. The fruit can weigh from 15-40 pounds each, making it a top choice for restaurants and family meals.",

Mr. Ives had received seeds from a friend in Northampton, Mass, who had obtained his seeds from a friend in Buffalo, NY.

Northern researchers found a chance cross between the Essex and Quality varieties and they named their happy accident Buttercup. The rugged plants thrived in the notoriously brief N.D. growing season. Early maturity and natural insect resistance were appreciated by researchers, and exhaustive taste tests were conducted. Selection resulted in dusty aquamarine-colored fruit of perfect family serving size with bright orange flesh, of exceptional mild sweet flavor and creamy texture. University of North Dakota researchers exclaimed \u201cEach squash weighs 3- 3.5 pounds just enough to serve 5-6 people in one meal with no leftovers\u201d.

This is the squash that gained fame online and became known as the \u201c800 year old squash\u201d which, according to legend, seed was found in a \u201cclay ball\u201d at an historic site in Wisconsin. But other stories state that this squash was found in a cave by the Miami Nation. Whatever the story is, we know that squashes of this type have been grown by Native people in North America for hundreds of years and likely came from the Guatemala area, possibly over 1000 years ago. This fabulous Native American squash first came to our attention in 2015, at the 5th annual Heirloom Exposition in Santa Rosa, California. The magnificent fruit runs about 2-3 feet long and weighs up to 18 pounds. The color is a rich, bright orange, with lighter orange striping running the length of the banana-shaped fruit. The surface is mildly bumpy; the overall appearance is amazingly beautiful. Gete-Okosimin also proves to be delicious--sweet, with hints of melon, and possessing a wonderful smooth texture.

"AMAZING FLAVOR AND PRODUCTION! 95 days. The legendary pumpkin of the South and famously favored by Abraham Lincoln\u2019s family! Also known as White Crookneck Pumpkin, the custardy, dry flesh is outstanding in pies and other traditional squash recipes. The flavor is rich and buttery and subtly sweet but not overly saccharine, which makes it widely versatile. Many old timers prepare the flesh just like potatoes, which is how we like them, just saut\u00e9ed with a bit of garlic and olive oil. Southerners consider it the standard for pumpkin pie. This big, white fruit is oblong with a few faint small, green stripes, a crooked neck and bulbous bottom. The large vines are vigorous and especially well suited to the south and central U.S. Popular in southern Illinois, often cultivated in cornfields. A Native American squash that has an ancient history. Our foundation seed came from collector Kevin McCarty, who writes that the variety was grown continuously on a particular Illinois farm from 1830 to 1980, the original seed having been provided by Abraham Lincoln\u2019s parents! Indeed, according to historical record, Thomas Lincoln purchased seeds for Cushaw squash at the trading post in Lexington, Ky, took it home and grew it on his farm in Hodgenville, KY. When the Lincolns moved to Indiana and finally, Illinois, their beloved family heirloom Cushaw joined them. Grow this most delectable piece of American history!",

It is one of the most beautiful and unique of all squash. A perfect variety for market gardeners. The rich, sweet flesh is a deep yellow-orange and of good quality, delicious baked or in pies. The fruit weighs about 10 lbs each and is produced on vigorous vines. Originally from South America, this warty winter squash made its way back to Spain and found its popularity in Italy. This dark orange and sweet fleshed fruit was introduced to Venice in the late 1600s and quickly became a beloved addition to the culinary culture. The network of lagoons south of Venice has been inhabited since the 5th century. Originally the people there fished and hunted small game, harvested sea salt, grew fruit and eventually vegetables. The region became a major source of vegetables for the Venetians once the salt marshes were drained and cultivated. Winter squash became a key staple for the winter months and especially for the poor who could not afford or access meat as readily. The rich, dense Marina di Chioggia, storing for up to six months, filled this winter food gap, and its incredible depth of flavor quickly spread throughout Italy and the world. This beauty of a squash is still served on the canals of Venice, grilled with olive oil by the bargemen and served as a whole wedge. A sweet and savory delight, for sure! Its meaty and sweet texture has also made this pumpkin popular as a filling for ravioli and for making gnocchi.",

Dr. Martin used it as a breeding parent to create the True Black Brandywine tomato which I discussed several years ago in The Heirloom Gardener. Fejee Improved or True Beefsteak appeared as a new cross or selection about 1883 in the seed catalogs of David Landreth and Robert Buist of Philadelphia. Ideal for slicing, the fat, oblate fruit about 4 to 5 inches in diameter features maroon or brownish-purple flesh with a red \u201cbloody\u201d center as shown in the picture. It received the name Beefsteak because it resembled raw aged beef. Treat as a late season tomato. Due to the heavy fruit, plants should be staked or caged.",

"80-90 days. Potato leaf. This fine variety was sent to us by our friend, famed seed collector and food writer, William Woys Weaver, of Pennsylvania. It was passed down to him from his Quaker grandfather\u2019s collection dating back to the 1920s. As to its history, Will states \u201cThe \u2018true\u2019 Black Brandywine was bred sometime in the late 1920s by Dr. Harold E. Martin (1888-1959), a dentist turned plant breeder who is best remembered today for his famous pole lima with huge seeds. Dr. Martin lived in Westtown, Penn., only a few miles from my grandfather\u2019s place in West Chester, and the two were gardening buddies. It was through that connection that his grandfather managed to wheedle seed out of the good doctor, as well as the details on how he created it. Dr. Martin always had a high opinion of his plant creations and did not like to share them. He charged 25 cents a seed for his lima, unheard of in those days. And he never released his Black Brandywine to a seed company, nor did he share it with many people, so I am fairly certain it never circulated among growers like his popular lima bean. According to my grandfather, Black Brandywine was a controlled cross between Brandywine and the original brown Beefsteak tomato otherwise known as Fejee Improved. Fejee Improved is probably extinct.\u201d We thank Will for entrusting us with this great-tasting tomato that is extra large in size and full of the deep, earthy and sweet flavor that has made blackish-purple tomatoes so popular. Some fruit tended to crack, but the yield was heavy, and the plants were vigorous and did well in our hot Missouri summer. Superior for salsa and cooking. We enjoyed these all summer, both fresh and in countless recipes. A great home garden variety that will surely become a favorite.",

Extra long trusses are smothered in small red cherry-sized fruit that resists cracking.

The Thorburn\u2019s Lemon Blush tomato is a beefsteak from antiquity with such magnificent flavor it is a true wonder how it was lost for 107 years! It is thanks to Willliam Woys Weaver, legendary seed saver and heirloom expert, for saving and growing out this outstanding tomato. The variety was developed by Elbert Carman, a longtime editor of the Rural New Yorker Magazine, and first offered in the Thorburn\u2019s catalog in 1893. It remained a favorite offering until 1912 when it was reselected and renamed Lemon Queen tomato. The variety fell into obscurity until Weaver received the seeds from a rare collection in New Jersey and decided to grow it out and offer it, exclusively through Baker Creek. This large, juicy tomato has tropical fruit notes and perfect acidity balance. It is nearly coreless, with firm juicy flesh and few seeds. A true testament to the resilience of heirlooms; be sure to add this incredible artifact to your personal seed bank and garden!",

Now our corporate agriculture has been \u201ckindly\u201d suggested to native farmers who are losing thousands of years of plant breeding work. The 12-30 lb melons have hard light-green rinds that make them perfect for shipping and storage. The light color makes them resistant to sun burning.

In the early 1920s, Art Combe, a Southwestern plant expert and amateur prospector found a small woven pot filled with bright red watermelon seeds in an abandoned sandstone cave in Arizona\u2019s Mogollon Rim. The red seeds are believed to be hundreds, if not thousands, of years old! Art planted the seeds and just a few germinated. The fruit was small and crooknecked, unlike any other watermelon he had ever seen before, but the flavor was incredible! Art grew this ancient Native American watermelon for several decades, selecting the largest and most round specimens. The result of decades of selecting is a superb extra large watermelon with bright red extra sweet flesh. Art used a dry farming technique that allowed him to grow extra sweet watermelons with almost no irrigation in the searing hot desert; these watermelons are extremely heat and drought tolerant!",

In 2008, Mike Kiessel, watermelon expert of Leelanau County, Michigan, decided to cross the Orangeglo watermelon with a Crimson Sweet. After years of selecting and perfecting, the Leelanau Sweetglo has completely won our hearts and triumphed at our annual tasting trials! A new favorite orange-fleshed variety that matures early and is excellent for northern growing.",

"70 days. An outstanding and super rare all-golden mini melon. Baker Creek has been searching for an all-yellow watermelon for many years. These incredibly small and early producing melons are just what we\u2019ve been pining after-- a rich lemon-yellow color from skin to flesh! Like striking gold, this glorious gilded watermelon was the stuff of dreams and legend. The excitement was palpable as these Asian type, pocket sized melons began to ripen on vine at the trials. We were thrilled with the vigorous growing habit and productivity; each vine blossoming and providing perfect single serving sized 1-2 pound fruit with flavor that is unparalleled, candy sweet and crispy textured. A perfect little snacking melon with super thin rind. In fact, the flesh is edible all the way down to the skin. A perfect home garden or local market melon, as the thin skin is not well suited to long distance shipping. The vines produce tons of the personal sized melons. Will throw a small percentage of green skinned fruit.",

The flesh is candied and stuffed into dessert pastries, stewed into hearty winter soups, stir fried and used to fill moon cakes for China\u2019s Autumn Moon Festival. Fruit can weigh up to 75 pounds each. This beautiful black type is a popular wax melon variety in China, but still unknown here. Named for the long dark fruit which resembles a bullet. Excellent storage quality and snow-white flesh. An excellent substitute for zucchini squash, but these are tastier! Thin (and eat) young fruit to get giant-sized fruit. ",
